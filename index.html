        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <img src="images/mmpic1-200pxW.png" alt="portrait of
        Michael Mulligan" width: "200px"; />
        <p>My work ethic stems from growing up on a small horse farm in PA, where
          feeding and caring for animals and the farm itself was a responsibility
          24/7/365.  My first career was being a Tennis Professional at some of the
          top-ranked clubs in the United States, using my work ethic to
          out-perform peers and staff in senior job titles.  I thrive on creating
          goals that are difficult to achieve, and then achieving them.</p>
        <p>My character is shaped from my faith, my family, and my passion to
          overcome challenges in life.  My strengths include <strong>honesty, integrity,
          a drive to improve, creation of win-win scenarios</strong> for all parties involved,
          and a positive attitude, among others.  I pride myself on both the
          profitable tennis acadamy I started and operated for seven years, as well
          as the unprofitable regional marketing company I started.  I learned from
          both experiences, and I am a better person today because of both of these
          companies.</p>

        <p>For 20 years, I utilized my dual-major Bachelor of Science degree from
          Ferris State University, in both Marketing and Professional Tennis
          Management, as a Tennis Pro.  I have coached tennis students of all ages, and in abilities
          ranging from beginner to a professional on the WTA (Women's Pro Tour).  I
          have "given back" to the community as a volunteer coach for the MaliVai
          Washington Foundation in Jacksonville, FL.  Helping other people enjoy
          life, building confidence in themselves, and realizing their fullest potential
          on- and off-court continues to be a passion of mine as I have migrated
          <strong>from Tennis Coach to Entrepreneur to Consultant to Mentor</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>After making significant contributions to four of the top-150 ranked
          private membership clubs in the United States, including being
          recognized as teaching the most lessons at the #2-ranked club in USA,
          my next goal is to scale larger.  Instead of helping 1-100 people
          simultaneously, like I can do while teaching tennis or running tennis
          events, <strong>I want to scale larger to help thousands or millions of people
          simultaneously</strong>, by creating Java programs that enrich lives of other
          people, while being scalable for growth beyond what I can imagine
          today, and while creating a profit for my organization.  I believe
          that the ultimate commodities are <strong>time and health</strong>.
          <span style="background-color: yellow; border: thin solid red;">I dream of
          creating efficiencies for people, via Java programming, so that people
          can spend more of their time healthly, shared with their loved ones.</span>

        <p>Tennis remains a passion for me.  I enjoy teaching tennis, especially to
          children ages 6-12, where I feel I can help shape their confidence in all
          aspects of their lives.  Additionally, I enjoy helping adults to
          remember that tennis improvement will happen as a byproduct of keeping
          the <b><ins>FUN</ins></b> included in their tennis play!</p>
        <p>Other hobbies include travels, learning, philosophy, art, photography,
          writing, nutrition, helping others, math, nature, movies, and reflecting
          about famous quotes that inspire me.  One of these quotes is a portion
          of a poem by Samuel Beckett, <span style="background-color: palegreen;
          border: thin solid black;">"Ever tried.  Ever failed.  No matter.
          Try again.  Fail again.  Fail better."</span></p>
