            <p>My work ethic stems from growing up on a small horse farm in PA, where
              feeding and caring for animals and the farm itself was a responsibility
              24/7/365.  My first career was being a Tennis Professional at some of the
              top-ranked clubs in the United States, using my work ethic to
              out-perform peers and staff in senior job titles.  I thrive on creating
              goals that are difficult to achieve, and then achieving them.
              Helping other people enjoy life, building confidence in themselves,
              and realizing their fullest potential on- and off-court continues to
              be a passion of mine as I have migrated <span class="bold">from Tennis Coach to
              Entrepreneur to Consultant to Mentor</span>
