        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/mmpic1-200pxW.png" alt="portrait of
        Michael Mulligan" width="250" class="left" />
          <p>My work ethic stems from growing up on a small horse farm in PA, where
            feeding and caring for animals and the farm itself was a responsibility
            24/7/365.  My first career was being a Tennis Professional at some of the
            top-ranked clubs in the United States, using my work ethic to
            out-perform peers and staff in senior job titles.  I thrive on creating
            goals that are difficult to achieve, and then achieving them.
            Helping other people enjoy life, building confidence in themselves,
            and realizing their fullest potential on- and off-court continues to
            be a passion of mine as I have migrated <span class="bold">from Tennis Coach to
            Entrepreneur to Consultant to Mentor</span>
          </p>
          <p>My character is shaped from my faith, my family, and my passion to
            overcome challenges in life.  My strengths include <span class="bold">honesty, integrity,
            a drive to improve, creation of win-win scenarios</span> for all parties involved,
            and a positive attitude, among others.  Instead of helping 1-100 people
            simultaneously, like I can do while teaching tennis or running tennis
            events, <span class="bold">I want to scale larger to help thousands or millions of people
            simultaneously</span>, by creating Java programs that enrich lives of other
            people, while being scalable for growth beyond what I can imagine
            today, and while creating a profit for my organization.  I believe
            that the ultimate commodities are <span class="bold">time and health</span>.
            <span class="highlight">I dream of
            creating efficiencies for people, via Java programming, so that people
            can spend more of their time healthly, shared with their loved ones.</span>

          <p>Tennis remains a passion for me.  I enjoy teaching tennis, especially to
            children ages 6-12, where I feel I can help shape their confidence in all
            aspects of their lives.  Additionally, I enjoy helping adults to
            remember that tennis improvement will happen as a byproduct of keeping
            the <span class="bold underline">FUN</span> included in their tennis play!</p>
          <p>Other hobbies include travels, learning, philosophy, art, photography,
            writing, nutrition, helping others, math, nature, movies, and reflecting
            about famous quotes that inspire me.  One of these quotes is a portion
            of a poem by Samuel Beckett, <span style="background-color: palegreen;
            border: thin solid black;">"Ever tried.  Ever failed.  No matter.
            Try again.  Fail again.  Fail better."</span></p>
